# CLASSIFICATION
# Overview
* This repository contains a classification model implemented in Python for predicting survival outcomes on the Titanic dataset. The model predicts whether a passenger aboard the Titanic would have survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

# Dataset
* The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset has been split into training and test sets for model training and evaluation.

# Model
The classification model implemented in this repository uses Logit Regression for training and prediction. It takes into account various features from the dataset to predict the survival status of passengers.

# Dependencies
* Python 3.x
Required libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

# Outcome
* The model will output the predicted survival outcome for the passenger.[open](
